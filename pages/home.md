Iâ€™m a software engineer from the UK, currently working as a _Senior Technical Lead_.

I live in the countryside with my beautiful partner, cats and dog.

My day job consists mostly of _TypeScript_ and _Java_ on _Azure_, working with tools like Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Vagrant and Packer.

In my free time, I'm currently enjoying learning **Go** and dabbling in **Rust**.
