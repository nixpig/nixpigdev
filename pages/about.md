| 2000 | After 'finishing' school at 16, I found myself with a considerable amount of free time on my hands and little to do. My younger brother had dabbled in web and games development, and there were a number of books just lying around the family computer. I figured 'what the hell' and picked one up - 'Learn Java in ...' (remember those?!). Needless to say, I didn't learn Java in the advertised timeframe. I didn't learn Java at all. Not even the tiny subset of Java that would have fit on the measly 100 or so pages. Instead, I picked up another book. I forget the name, but it was something to do with building web pages in HTML. I managed to get pretty good at it. While I didn't pursue it properly at the time, over the next few years I did end up building a number of websites - the restaurant where I later worked, the local constituency party of the political party I was then affiliated with, amongst others - whilst I was working various bar and restaurant jobs. |

| 2007 | After living and working in Spain for 2 years, I returned to the UK, kind-of lost as to what to do. I spent a number of months just living off savings and spending days mindlessly browsing the internet. I distinctly remember a moment where I noticed a 'make money online' link at the bottom of a website for some trashy product and, out of bored curiosity, clicked it. And so began my foray into the world of online affiliate marketing. Over the next 4 years, I built a total of around 400 product websites, generating traffic through SEO. After about the first 40, it became evident that managing this number of web properties is not something that's easy to do manually, so I looked for solutions. I ended up building my own automation around this in PHP + MySQL - managing content updates, and all manner of other tasks.                                                                                                                                                 |

| 2011 | In the beginning of 2011, Google introduced their 'Panda' update and things started to go downhill. By mid 2012, with Google's 'Penguin' update, the writing was on the wall - SEO was not a valid strategy for anybody but the already huge online properties already dominating the SERPs. FWIW, this is still the case today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 2012 | Having decided that this (tech, programming, the web) was where I wanted to be, and with no 'qualifications' to speak of, I enrolled as a 'mature student' at college on a "Access to Higher Education - Software Development" course. Somehow, I completely dominated it, scoring 100% in every class, despite making life difficult for myself by deciding to learn and complete every project in a different language - PHP, Lua, Objective-C, VB.NET, and JavaScript..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
